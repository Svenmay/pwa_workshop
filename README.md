# pwa_demo
Simple "Hello World" repo to demonstrate how to integrate a Service Worker (based on Workbox).

These files could be used during a workshop to demonstrate how to build a web site with a Service Worker (based on Workbox).

# Content
- var1_basic: A simple step-by-step version of the web site. Building a service worker from scratch and extend it feature by feature.
- var2_webpack_recommended: Same web site as before, but this time using webpack to generate the service worker with the help of workbox-webpack plugin
- var3_webpack_GenerateSW: Same web site as before, using webpack again, but this time using the "GenerateSW" module of workbox to generate a service worker.
- bonus_tip: Same site as before, no webpack, but a nice extra bonus tip. Use AMP to preload the service worker for your site while the user is still on e.g. Google.com.
